Description of data in the paper:
"Inhibitory and excitatory populations in parietal cortex are equally selective for decision outcome in both novices and experts"

Each folder in "FN_dataSharing" belongs to a mouse discussed in the paper.

Inside each "mouse" folder, there are folders for each session of experiment (imaging during decision making).

Inside each "session" folder, two .mat files exist:

1) "post_*" file includes variables such as the activity of each neuron aligned on the choice ("firstSideTryAl"), trial outcomes ("outcomes"), stimulus rates ("stimrate"), animal's response side ("allResp_HR_LR"), etc. 

2) "more_*" file includes variables such as which neurons are inhibitory ("inhibitRois_pix"), and what neurons have poor quality, hence excluded from analyses ("badROIs01"), etc.
