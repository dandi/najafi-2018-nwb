The description of data:

Each folder in "FN_dataSharing" belongs to a mouse discussed in the paper:

"Inhibitory and excitatory populations in parietal cortex are equally selective for decision outcome in both novices and experts"
Farzaneh Najafi, Gamaleldin F Elsayed, Eftychios Pnevmatikakis, John P Cunningham, Anne K Churchland 

Inside each "mouse" folder, there are folders, each belonging to a session of experiment.

Inside each "session" folder, 2 .mat files exist:

1) "post_*" file includes variables such as the activity of each neuron aligned on the choice ("firstSideTryAl"), trial outcomes ("outcomes"), stimulus rates ("stimrate"), animal's response side ("allResp_HR_LR"), etc. 

2) "more_*" file includes variables such as which neurons are inhibitory neurons
