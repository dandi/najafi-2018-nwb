External-Description: Datasets from Najafi, Farzaneh and Elsayed, Gamaleldin F and Pnevmatikakis, Eftychios and Cunningham, John P and Churchland, Anne K (2018) Inhibitory and excitatory populations in parietal cortex are equally selective for decision outcome in both novices and experts
External-Identifier: http://dx.doi.org/10.14224/1.36980
Internal-Description: Each folder in "FN_dataSharing" belongs to a mouse discussed in the paper.  Inside each "mouse" folder, there are folders for each session of experiment (imaging during decision making).  Inside each "session" folder, two .mat files exist: 1) post_* file includes variables such as the activity of each neuron aligned on the choice (firstSideTryAl), trial outcomes (outcomes), stimulus rates (stimrate), animal's response side (allResp_HR_LR), etc.  2) more_* file includes variables such as which neurons are inhibitory (inhibitRois_pix), and what neurons have poor quality, hence excluded from analyses (badROIs01), etc.
